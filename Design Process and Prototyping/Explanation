After creating ideas of what I wanted to include I moved onto the designing of the house to include as many passive systems as I was able to, this mainly being the air circulation.
to include the best air circulation I could, I decided to face the house to the north and allow the windows to have little breaks in direction to allow air to flow throughout the house from the back all the way through the living areas.
to see my original design look at Example.1a under Design Process and Prototyping.

After the direction and basic floorplan of the house was complete I moved onto designing the vertical part of the house, ending up with the total height of 1.5m for the interior roof and then upto 2.5m total height for the tallest point on the roof on the outside.

From this point I moved onto the model of the house out of card board, following all of the plans I wrote down in my book.
all of the images titled for the house are under the 'card board house' folder

After having the layout of my house done I moved onto the planning for the systems Im adding to the house model.
This had me going to TinkerCad to create online prototypes, this allowed me to create my circuit before and after class when I was working on creating the files to make the house out of MDF.

I First started with connecting the PIR sensor to the white LED, to create a motion sensing light. The way I connected the PIR and LED together through a Arduino was by Signal Pin on the PIR to the 2 pin on the Arduino, taking the signal the PIR gave and then using that as a variable to see if the value given changes, leading to the LED which is connected to the 4 pin of the Arduino to be given a HIGH output.
I also tried to connect a button to the board to act as a toggle switch, by reading the previous state of the button, as in it starts off as a HIGH or LOW state, but when pin 3 changes value for any amount of time it switches the state of pin 12, in turn storing the value and allowing the light to either turn on if motion is detected or remain off depending if the 'light switch' was turned on or not.

After the circuit for the light was completed i moved onto the next circuit i wanted to design, which was the the temperature controlled fan, this was dont by connecting the Fans posative pin to the 6 pin on the arduino and the tempreature sensor to the 5 pin, after they are connected i can tell the arduino to take the temperature sensors output in celcius, then by using a if statement i can turn on the fan if it reaches above a certain temperature, around 30 degrees would be good for the design.

finally i moved onto the automatic blinds
