After creating ideas of what I wanted to include I moved onto the designing of the house to include as many passive systems as I was able to, this mainly being the air circulation.
to include the best air circulation I could, I decided to face the house to the north and allow the windows to have little breaks in direction to allow air to flow throughout the house from the back all the way through the living areas.
to see my original design look at Example.1a under Design Process and Prototyping.

After the direction and basic floorplan of the house was complete I moved onto designing the vertical part of the house, ending up with the total height of 1.5m for the interior roof and then upto 2.5m total height for the tallest point on the roof on the outside.
