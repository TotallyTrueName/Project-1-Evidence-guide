The Accessablility implications of the smart home are actually very positive, smart homes provide a very simple way to interact with houseing,
this could be able to help some people with disabilities, providing a simple way to interact with their homes features while also allowing 
for automation of trivial tasks that might face disabled people with challenges.

the possibility of simplisity for the user allows for the accessibility of smart homes to be very understandable, convenient and approachable
for everyone that wants to buy either a newly built smart home, or to install new technology to their current home with basically no need for
large scale construction work.

My personal design of a model smart home did not take into account the accessibility of the user, mainly taking into account the effectiveness
of the system itself if it was completed, meaning that to customise or turn of many of the features you would need to turn off everything 
instead of a singular appliance.
