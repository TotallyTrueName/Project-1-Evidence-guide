Smart homes face one very large ethical issue, the collection, storage and sale or distribution of information collected by the smart homes.
many smart homes are connected to the internet in many ways, even things like fridges are connected to the internet nowadays, this leads to
One very large and very valid concern held by many, what do the companies that produce these smart home products do with their information.

this is a ethical issue because unlike things like internet browsing data that can a lot of the time reveal very little about the actual 
person besides temporary curiosity, smart homes usually have many cameras and microphones, all of which could be storing any amount of data,
if one of these companies decided they wanted to record and store then sell videos or information about people's daily lives it would be a
very large breach of privacy, all of this would be done through the legal channels as in terms and conditions and privacy policies, meaning
that a large population of people would be completely unaware of their personal life being filmed and shared between companies without
their knowledge even if their did sign the terms and conditions and privacy policies, 
"91% of consumers accept the terms and conditions without reading them" (Cakebread, 2017).

however a system like my own would not be nearly as ethically questionable and scary as there is no direct internet connection, the system 
works completely off it self, needing no other input besides the circuitry that is contained within itself
