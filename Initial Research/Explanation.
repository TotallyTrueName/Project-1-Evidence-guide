From the start of the assignment I wrote down many things that would help with creating a design and including passive and active systems to
help create a power efficient house model.

The first thing I started with was the documenting any ideas of active systems given by the teacher during week one or my own ideas, this
helped me get an idea of what was needed from the task and helped me get an idea of what I might want to do later on.
To see the list please see the Example.1 and Example.2 under Initial research.

After that I decided to move onto passive systems of power efficiency, things like Insulation and Air circulation, also deciding where this
house might be set to help create an idea of what might be needed.
To see the pages of notes please see the Example.3 under Initial research.

After deciding what I wanted to include, this being passive systems like, house orientation, air circulation and glazed windows, alongside
active systems like automatic blinds, motion sensing lights and temperature controlled fans, I moved onto the design and process part of
the assignment.
